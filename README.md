# Static Design Project - HTML and CSS

## Introduction

This project is a static design implementation using clean and semantic HTML along with easily maintainable CSS. The primary goal is to create a design without any interactivity, focusing on a responsive and visually appealing layout. Vanilla CSS has been used for styling. The project is submitted as a zip file, and this README provides an overview of the project.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the webpage.
- `nav_and_footer.css`: The main CSS file for styling the header and footer of the page.
- `cards.css`: The main CSS file for the styling of the main card and index cards.
- `img/`: Directory for storing image assets used in the project.

The design is based on the requirements provided and is intended for a static webpage. The design consists of the following key sections:

### Navigation Bar (`.navbar`):

- A clean and responsive navigation bar with a company logo and navigation links.
- Social media links in the footer (`nav-socials`).

### Card Main Section (`.card-main-container`):
